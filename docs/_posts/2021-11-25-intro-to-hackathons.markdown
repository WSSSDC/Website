### Process

There is a 4 step proccess that many hackathon teams follow when creating their project.

- Idea
- Design
- Execution
- Presentation

### Idea

The most common factors used to judge an idea are:

- Originality
- Technical Impressiveness
- Adherance to Theme
- Social Good

These do not apply to all hackathons, and it's usually a good idea to check the judging criteria before working on a hackathon project.

One think to think about when thinking of an idea are themed prizes. Some of these are sponsored prizes, which are prizes that have been donated by a sponsor, and many have a requirement to be eligible for the prize. A common requirement is to use the sponsors software in your project (eg. "Best use of Google Cloud"). Other prizes will reward the best project in a particular field (eg. "Best Design").

### Design

This step is something many hackathon teams skip, but I believe it is important for creating a professional-looking project. I recommend using mockup software like [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/xd.html) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com), but pen and paper also work. It is also helpful to include professional icons and images in your project. Many are free, and help make your project look good. If your hackathon has a theme, try to incorporate it into your design.

### Execute

When you're finished your design, it's time to make it real. Your first step is to decide how you will build it. Here are some common frameworks for building your project:

#### Websites

- Native (HTML, CSS, JS)
- ReactJS
- Drag and Drop (Bootstrap Studio, Webflow, Wordpress...)

#### Mobile Apps

- Native (XCode/Swift, Android Studio)
- Flutter
- React Native

#### Games

- PyGame
- Unreal Engine
- Unity

This is just a breif overview of some frameworks that could help with your project. You can also just use your favourite programming language.

### Presentation

This topic is also overlooked by many hackathon teams, but it is one of the most important. Judges will make decisions based solely off the information provided in your presentation. They don't have anything else. It's common to leave this to the last minute, but you should try to leave as much time as possible to work on your it.

The three ways you may present your project are live (in-person/video call), video, and devpost. Most hackathons will require a devpost article explaining your project. When writing this, keep the judging criteria in mind and highlight the best parts of your project. Many hackathons also require a demo video. This is where you can show your project working, and talk about how you built it. Sometimes, hackathons will require that you give a live presentation to judges. It is a good idea to plan out who on your team will speak about what ahead of time. They will also usually allow slideshows.

Final note: if your hackathon has a theme, especially a silly one, try to embrace it in your presentation.

Hackathons are a great way to build your skills, and I hope this article helps you build great projects. If you want to reach out, you can message me on discord (con266667#9315).
